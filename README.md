# cantinaband
A barebones [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) bot

## What is this?
This connects to a specific channel in a specific discord server and continuously plays the cantina band music on loop forever indefinitely constantly presistently always all the time endlessly incessantly repeatedly.

## How do I use this bot?
Firstly, you shouldn't use this bot.

Then you'll need a discord bot application created over on the [discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

Create a `private.key` file in the working directory and make sure you have [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) in your PATH variables

Lastly, copy your discord bot application's private key into the `private.key` file and viol√°, you can now run this program without issue.*


*You will run in to issues, there are hardcoded channel and guild ids, change them.
